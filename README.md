## HEDGING

Hedging in finance is a risk management strategy. It deals with reducing the risk of uncertainty related
to the adverse price fluctuations in an asset.
The aim of this strategy is to restrict the losses that may arise due to unknown fluctuations in the
investment prices and to lock the profits therein. It works on the principle of offsetting i.e. taking an opposite
and equal position in two different markets. In simple terms, it is hedging one investment by investing in some
other investment.
Similarly, when you secure your 'A' investment's loss by offsetting it with 'B' investment's profit, it
known as 'Hedging’.

## AREAS OF HEDGING
 #### COMMODITIES - Commodities include agricultural products, energy products, metals, etc.
 #### SECURITIES - Securities include investments in shares, equities, indices, etc.
 #### CURRENCIES - Currencies include foreign currencies & crypto currencies.
 #### INTEREST RATES - Interest rates include the lending and borrowing rates.

## HEDGING TYPES
Not only for reducing risk, hedging is also useful as a means to earn profits by trading in various commodities, securities or
currencies. Depending on these areas, broadly there are three types of hedging:

➢ FORWARD : Forward (or a Forward Contract) is a non-standardized contract to buy or sell an asset between two independent
parties at an agreed price and a specified date.

➢ FUTURES : Futures (or a Futures Contract) is a standardized contract to buy or sell an asset between two independent parties at
an agreed price standardized quantity, and a specific date.

➢ MONEY MARKETS : It is one of the major components of financial markets today, where short-term leg, borrowing, buying and
selling are done with the maturity of one year or less.

## HEDGING STRATEGIES
A hedging strategy generally refers to the risk reduction technique of an investment. To face such situations, a business can
implement few strategies which are as follows:

➢ HEDGING THROUGH ASSET ALLOCATION : You can do this by diversifying your portfolio with more than one type of asset. For e.g.
you can invest 70% in equity and the rest 30% in other more stable assets, to create a balanced portfolio.

➢ HEDGING THROUGH STRUCTURES : You can do this by investing a portion of the portfolio in debt and the other in derivatives.
Where debt portion brings stability to the portfolio, the derivatives help in protecting it from the downside risk.

➢ HEDGING THROUGH OPTIONS : You can do this by buying a call option and selling a put option and vice-versa. This helps directly
in protecting the portfolio, especially the equity portfolio.

## Arbitrage
Arbitrage is the process of exploiting differences in the price of an asset by simultaneously buying and selling it. In the process the
arbitrageur pockets a risk-free return. Differences in prices usually occur because of imperfect dissemination of information.
Arbitrage occurs when a security is purchased in one market and simultaneously sold in another market at a higher price, thus
considered to be risk-free profit for the trader.

Arbitrage provides a mechanism to ensure prices do not deviate substantially from fair value for long periods of time. With
advancements in technology, it has become extremely difficult to profit from pricing errors in the market. Many traders have computerized
trading systems set to monitor fluctuations in similar financial instruments. Any inefficient pricing setups are usually acted upon quickly,
and the opportunity is often eliminated in a matter of seconds. Arbitrage is a necessary force in the financial marketplace.

Arbitrage opportunities exist when the prices of similar assets are set at different levels. This opportunity allows an investor to
achieve a profit with zero risk and limited funds by simply selling the asset in the overpriced market and simultaneously buying it in the
cheaper market.

This buying and selling of the asset will push the cheaper asset's price up and the higher asset price down. This process will
continue until the asset price is equal in both markets.

## Correlation
Correlation, in the finance and investment industries, is a statistic that measures the degree to which two securities
move in relation to each other. Correlations are used in advanced portfolio management, computed as the correlation
coefficient, which has a value that must fall between -1 and 1.

A perfect positive correlation means that the correlation coefficient is exactly 1. This implies that as one security
moves, either up or down, the other security moves in lockstep, in the same direction. A perfect negative correlation means
that two assets move in opposite directions, while a zero correlation implies no relationship at all.

For example, large-cap mutual funds generally have a high positive correlation to the Standard and Poor's (S&P) 500
Index - very close to 1. Small-cap stocks have a positive correlation to that same index, but it is not as high – generally around
0.8.

However, put option prices and underlying stock prices tend to have a negative correlation. As the stock price
increases, the put option prices go down. This is a direct and high-magnitude negative correlation.
